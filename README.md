# Attention-is-all-you-need
I have used python torch library to make this mind blowing Project. There is a research paper named " Attention is all you need" where it talks about Attention mechanism that can be developed using proper application of Encoder and Decoder. I have done the coding from scratch without employing any extra library made on this topic. This mechanism is used by all of us while reading a book because when we read a word from a sentence, that instant of time we see only that word which we are reading and the rest sentences are blur in our eyes. That's attention Mechanism ;)
